RocketOrbit - Projectile Motion Simulator

This project simulates projectile motion with and without air resistance
on different planets (Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury,
Neptune, Venus, Uranus). It calculates flight time, maximum height, and
range. The motion is visualized with Matplotlib animation.
